          We've outlined our Terms of Service and Full Value Replacement Coverage in simple
          language for quick reference. For interstate moves, the FMCSA also provides
          brochures regarding your legal rights.

            We bill differently for interstate moves, as mandated by law. We will determine a flat rate
            and provide a quote, rather than create an hourly-based estimate.
