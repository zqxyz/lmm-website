          No doubt we're well acquanted with storage units, ten years
          ago our story started in one! Founding partner Alex Sargent
          got the idea to start a moving company after overhearing
          complaints about the moving experience and attitude of the
          movers people had hired. Ned Swain, a frequent customer,
          liked the idea so much he brought it to two other friends,
          Jake Holz and Jon Donnell. Soon after, Local Muscle was
          born with the driving idea that customer service and attitude
          of the crews will be what sets us apart. The results
          speak for themselves.
